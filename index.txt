LETRS Empowers Reading Teachers with Critical Instructional Tools

Dear %%first_name%%,

Learning to read is a complex skill and teaching reading can be a challenging process. Teachers benefit from professional development based on the science of how reading and language work together to build strong literacy skills.

LETRS® (Language Essentials for Teachers of Reading and Spelling), authored by renowned literacy experts Dr. Louisa Moats and Dr. Carol Tolman, is an evidence-based solution that prepares educators with the skills they need to be effective teachers of reading.
